Writer of this article and CEO of the Polycode. I played with computers since I was in 2nd standard. Learnt about its power and application in college. 
Got into IT industry where I saw its real impact on people's lives. Now I try to bring digital power to people's lives through Polycode.
When I am not working, I play video games, hangout with my friends and family, ride bike and watch anime. I am in Twitter if you wanna know more! [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kaichogami).

Earlier I found new technologies amusing and was impressed how they work. 
Now I build them with all scalable and safe methodologies available in the industry which directly or indirectly impacts the world and its people through Polycode. 
I believe anything and everything is possible through technology.
