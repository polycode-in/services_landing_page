## Short Answer -> Digital Agency
Now time for the longer answer.
**Agency** is easy to understand. It is an organisation looking to provide its services for a fee.
**Digital** is hard to explain in words. Best way for me to say would be to explain how I imagine it.

**When I think of digital** I think about keyboard, mouse, touch screen, browser, internet, google, information, computers, phones, apps, robot, automation, code, **instagram**, facebook, tiktok, twitter, youtube, **whatsapp**, telegram, **amazon**, flipkart, infosys, tcs, Tesla, zomato, swiggy, uber, ola, olx, makemytrip, justdial machine learning, artificial intelligence, blockchain, bitcoin, **crypto**, zerodha, cams online, netbanking, upi, **google pay**, startup, cred, android, iphone, pixel,
counter strike, pubg, valorant, hashtags, meme, reel, viral.... 

**Polycode** can help you if are not really sure what **links these digital ideas** together **/ OR /** you know what ties it together but do not know where and how to start making it. 
We will help you connect your idea of **digital** into your life and business. How will it help your business? How much **money can you save**?
Will the **digital system** require **human assistance** in future? To what extent can it be **automated**? Will its lifetime **cost outweight its return**?
We will help you answer these questions and **build it as close to your idea**.
