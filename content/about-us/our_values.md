Values for us are code to live by. At polycode we know that we aren't equipped to handle all situations in optimal way.
When we are presented in such situations we follow our values to minimise are risks, losses and regret even if it is
not the way to get most money. 
* **Customer is King** ðŸ‘‘. We take inspiration from Amazon's Jeff Bezos in valuing customer's view at highest. At every decision
point we put our thoughts whether a customer is ultimately benefetting with the change. If they are not, then is it really
worth pursuing the change?
* **Uncertainity is unavoidable, deal with it** ðŸ˜Ž. Not sure of something? Thats okay. Actually thats the only possibilty. Its almost impossible to say with 100% certainity that something is going to happen. We encourage everyone at polycode to
think in probablistic manner. If there are 2 outcomes possible we put the two outcomes in percetange range(10-90%, 35-65%). The act of putting outcomes in range lets us know if what we are doing has good chances of success.
* **Focus on problems, answers would come to you** ðŸ›¬. There is an art at framing questions. Questions are the first point where our thinking begins. It is the question which guides the answer to its point. A wrong question answered might be `correct` but it does not solve the problem at hand. Therefore we spend considerable time on understanding, framing problems before diving into the solutions. Solutions are usually one of the last steps for us.
* **Simple is beautiful** ðŸŸ£. Richard Feymann said, `if you can't explain to 5 year old kid, then you dont understand it`. We strive to make all our creations simple. This is hard to do, but its worth it. If we see something is getting too
hard to understand or too big then we step back and trace back where we went wrong.
