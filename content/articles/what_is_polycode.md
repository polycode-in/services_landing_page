## Short Answer -> Digital Agency
Now time for the longer answer.
`Agency` is easy to understand. It is an organisation looking to provide its services for a fee.
`Digital` is hard to explain in words. Best way for me to say would be to explain how I imagine it.
When I think of digital I think about keyboard, mouse, touch screen, browser, internet, google, information, computers, phones, apps, robot, automation, code, instagram, facebook, tiktok, twitter, youtube, whatsapp, telegram, amazon, flipkart, infosys, tcs, Tesla, zomato, swiggy, uber, ola, olx, makemytrip, justdial machine learning, artificial intelligence, blockchain, bitcoin, crypto, zerodha, cams online, netbanking, upi, google pay, startup, cred, android, iphone, pixel,
counter strike, pubg, valorant, hashtags, meme, reel, viral.... 

**Polycode** can help you if are not really sure what **links these `digital ideas`** together **/ OR /** you know what ties it together but do not know where and how to start making it. 
We will help you connect your idea of `digital` into your life and business. How will it help your business? How much **money can you save**?
Will the `digital system` require **human assistance** in future? To what extent can it be **automated**? Will its lifetime **cost outweight its return**?
We will help you answer these questions and **build it as close to your idea**.
