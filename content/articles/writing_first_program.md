## Umm, Excuse me, write a program?
Program is basically piece of code. Code is instruction that computers understand. So title is saying, "Giving computer the first instruction". I like to secretly call **computer my slave**. It does whatever I ask it to do. I realised that after writing my first program. Writing the first program and seeing it run successfuly is like tasting your own cooked or looking at the lego spacecraft you just made or driving car for the first time in traffic or writing your first story in facebook. I dont know what I have created is good or bad. Nevertheless its an accomplishment and a step closer to understanding the skill in question. 

## What does it mean to a non-technical person like me ?
The realisation that computers are power machines who work exactly as you tell them do is something that comes from writing a first program. Setting up your computer, understanding the basic nuances of the programming language(python, C, JAVA etc), executing the program and seeing the result. This is not something that can be conveyed through words or video or any media. It is to be experienced. 

Lets say you want to learn to drive so that it makes your daily life easier. But you dont have a car and you arent really sure if there is anyone who can give you time to teach you how to drive. So you do what any person would do. Pay money to some driving school and they let you experience first hand to drive a car. You pay for renting the car, the driver who teaches you, the school who organises and markets their services. Quite costly. But worth it. 

For learning to code, you need a desktop/laptop(which I assume 80% of our readers should have access to one). You need a **force** which compels you to learn. In case of driving its the convinience you get in your daily transportation. In case of programming, **its curiosity, a business need, hobby, for career and maybe for some other reasons**. These reasons are personal and differs for everyone. The only thing matters is that you have decided to learn to code. And finally you need a tutor or a mentor who tells you what to do. Mentors in this age can be a person who lives near you or lives 3500Km away from you. It can be a book or an Ebook. It can be a magazine series or a series of blog posts. It can be a coaching center or an online course. There are a lot of options to choose from.


So if you, the non-tech person decides to write the first program to understand where really your money goes into, **Polycode has come up with an innovative solution**. We will divide your task or the **problem statement into smaller chunks** like we always do. However **we will keep a certain, beginner friendly, low priority and easy chunk of work reserved for you**. We will sit together and discuss the nuances that goes behind just only for that piece of work. Then slowly with the pace of project you will get your hands dirty with some code** and get to understand the workings behind it. Learn by working as they say.

## Something like a course?
Yes maybe. Or maybe not. We believe in working practically. If you work 5 hours for the entire duration and read 5 hours for the entire duration, the **practical 5 hour work will give higher return**. Of course on longer span of time both are needed. Like what is done in courses. This short demo work is for fun and the idea is to introduce the idea of coding to you. As long as you want to learn, we are more than happy to teach you the work. Once you learn it, **it will be easier to make decisions on cost, effort and what sort of digital ideas can go with your work**. This of course comes with **no extra cost** to you.

## Thats all cool but I think I dont need to write the program. Just want my work done.
And that is fine too. We understand that you have lot going on your plate and learning about code is not be the priority. However if in future after your work is done and you get interested in learning we are more than happy to get you started! :)
